# C++ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

This software is designed to provide audio and visuals to a number of common sorting algorithm. Heavily influenced by the famous [15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg) - this is
simply my attempt at implementing my own version of this idea in order to reintroduce myself to SDL2 and general C++ Programming

## Dependencies

- MinGW-w64
- SDL2
- SDL2 TTF
- VSSynth

## How to build

While the majority of the required libraries are included within the repository, MinGW-w64 may have to be manually installed. 
Once all requirements are met, the singular makefile in the directory should be executed to create the executable file. 

If there are any issues with this method, please create a github issue and I'll work on it as soon as I can.
